# Simple WSGI Server With Redirects

This is a minimalist WSGI application in Python that serves files
and redirects based on the `_redirects` file in a similar fashion
to what [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) does.

This is primarily designed so you can serve a statically generated
list of files, but also maintain dynamic redirects for moved or
deleted paths.
